## 2. Problem Statement
The digital transformation of Kenyan businesses has exposed SMEs to significant cybersecurity risks. However, these enterprises often lack the financial resources and technical expertise required to implement robust cybersecurity measures. This leaves them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can lead to:
- Financial losses
- Data breaches
- Loss of customer trust

### Key Challenges Faced by SMEs:
- Limited awareness of cybersecurity risks.
- Lack of affordable and effective cybersecurity solutions.
- Insufficient resources and training to manage cyber threats.
